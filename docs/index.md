This website is for documenting the mod Fall From Heaven for Civilization VI, a port of Kael's excellent FallFromHeaven mod in Civilization IV. I started this mod completely new to the Civ VI community back in February, and have been at it ever since. I've reached a stage where I am happy to show some of my progress.

I'll be posting blogs of my current progress, and I have an informal [checklist](https://slothoth.github.io/Fall-From-Heaven/progress) that you could scan through to see what I've achieved so far.

the mod itself is open-source, so I would welcome any contributions if anyone else is nostalgic for the original mod.

You can also track the progress on my github: https://github.com/slothoth/Fall-From-Heaven
