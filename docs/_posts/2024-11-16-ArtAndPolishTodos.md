# Leader Art
Leader art has been extracted from FFH, and I've done a few passes of cleaning up backgrounds to make them transparent and upscaling them.
I've also tested implementing one, Alexis, into Civ. 

My issue is the low quality of the images really starts to show up in VI, and I would want to upscale them. I am not an artist though.
