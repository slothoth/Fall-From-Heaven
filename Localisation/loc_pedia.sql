Sebills view from the fifth floor spanned from the northern slums out to Nubias western wall and beyond that to where the countryside was trampled underfoot by mountains. Moving a crate of books, new acquisitions from the latest campaigns, she broke her gaze from the window. She was at odds with herself, technically, shed achieved her goal and become a chief librarian at the worlds greatest library. It was what she had promised her childhood friends shed do, then they in turn would dream up something they thought was even more fantastic. Yet here she was. Slaving. Forced into her wishes fulfillment by ravenous men under a new moon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Her town was alight with burning houses as she woke to the screams. She shook her husband awake, scrambled for her weapon, and used it on the first blood-drenched man who burst into the bedroom. His comrades behind him overpowered her. All she could remember feeling at that moment was insult at the fact that they showed no desire to kill her. Instead, one man constrained her on the bed while they dragged her husband outside. She shrieked and swung her fists, until an attacker brought a torch into the room. In the light the men saw the bedroom and its bookshelf-lined walls. Their faces flushed with joy and they shouted congratulations to each other. That was when they knocked her unconscious.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]...theres no noise whats going on? Im deaf no Im dead oh good theres noise the chains oh damn me the chains. How dare they keep me down here what did they do to her the next time one of them comes down here Ill wrap these chains around him...

Cant stop shaking the walls are too noisy I cant hear myself how can I... Huh? Theyre coming those are footsteps Ill kill them and Ill get out and find her oh Ill never see her again... One footsteps two feet could it be her they dont sound hard... oh my angel what if its her shes come to kill me oh my angel it is her![\\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sebill hadnt seen her husband since. And now there she was, the woman shed always wanted to be. Only the library wasnt what shed hoped for. It was supposed to be a paragon of learning, open to all, with a collection spanning history and all of Erebus. This was a perversion, a library of spoils, built on the sudden whim of that monstrous queen Alexis to actually know something about the people she and her brother were slaughtering. And shed let Flauros build it! It was a wonder he had any slaves left over to clean up the blood of those who built it. Sebill was horrified to hear that Alexis had been the one to finally build Erebuss greatest library, now known as the Library of Alexis. Sebill never wanted anything to do with it, but now she was its chief archivist. It was more of a wound than a title. Still, she had books. She passed the time by imagining that the library had been built by someone else: perhaps in the Kuriotate lands it would be a bridge across race and politics, in Amurite lands its knowledge would be treated with proper respect.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Books, protected by sturdy leather covers, were durable and could last ages if properly cared for. But books in Erebus were only as permanent as societies allowed. Warring nations expunged conquered peoples libraries with the rest of their culture. The Age of Ice preserved the previous ages treasures well, as long as firewood was more plentiful than books. The real damage came with the destruction of literate societies who knew the value of old histories and treatises. Still, Sebill thought, maybe Alexiss collection will serve some good in the long run. Perhaps Sebills dreams were not totally lost. Spending her days cataloging family histories, journals, folktales, scientific works, philosophies, and everything else brought in from homes and palace libraries gave her faith that one day this could be shared with the world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She unloaded the books onto the table-They were her books. She stared at them, telling herself that this was inevitable, and yet she was holding the books that belonged to her and her former neighbors. She tried to detach herself, but opening the covers felt like tearing new flesh off wounds. "Is this the last Ill ever see of my life?" she despaired. One book confirmed that it would be: a ledger, a report of the raid on her town.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]its her its her she came for me she sees me shell kill me I have to kill her Im scared I hate her I hate those men thats a sharp knife Im going to die I should die Im worthless Im afraid hate hate them her skin cuts so fine[\\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Come on you. Drink up."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]blood! shes bleeding I can taste it already these chains hurt I want her to notice me let me go I must taste her fingers the cut is so sharp I can feel the cut on my tongue Im okay Ill be okay she loves me Im home Im hers her hand is so soft it could tear me to pieces I want her to she can have me all in little bits shell protect me my angel my angel Ill climb under her shadow her dress Ill be engulfed in her darkness her peaceful darkness shell hold me and Ill be okay Ill be hers Ill be nothing in her abyss she loves me she will always protect me...[\\BOLD][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sneaking out was unnecessary. Sebill doubted it was because they trusted her, perhaps they were certain they could find her if she ran off. The masters ignored other slaves, but had to address her because of the role they gave her. Eye contact was rare, but they had an odd way of acknowledging her presence by letting her know they were smelling her. Tonight she was betting they wouldnt find her quickly enough.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ledger had listed the spoils, the "acquisitions." House #6 Contents. Books: 156. Woman: Educated: For especial use, she read. Man: Drunk, superior physical condition: For conscription in Red Barracks. Weapons only other items of value. She knew of the so-called "Red Barracks." Other librarians spoke fearfully, sorrowfully, of their loved ones sent there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She agonized during the following nights. After her life had been destroyed her only possible comfort was having all the worlds books and time enough at last to read. Now that had become her hell. The only truth she wanted was outside the library. She had to find the Red Barracks.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And she did. She was ushered right in through the front doors the moment she was spotted sneaking underneath a window. She protested, feigned ignorance, fought, but was pulled before a woman wrapping her hand in a bandage. Sebill froze, her. Alexis looked at Sebill with a sneer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Mistress, we found her snooping. She looks like-"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I dont care what she is. Come. Bring her." She turned and walked with her saturating, scarlet-bandaged hand at her side.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Bring her in here."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sebill was thrown to the floor in a small, windowless room. The light from the room outside shone past her, and onto a man chained to the wall. Sebill bounced to her feet, but was stunned when she saw him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Ain! Oh!" she shouted and ran to him. He stared at her without recognition and his lips trembled with senseless mutterings. Alexis entered the room and watched with contempt as Sebill tried to get Ain to look at her. Ain was transfixed by Alexis. Suddenly a look of eagerness showed on his face and he noticed Sebill for the first time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Ain! Its me, dear!" She shook Ain and rubbed his cheeks in growing hysteria. Her eyes widened in both fear and hope when Ain looked at her. In him she saw savagery mixed with his eagerness to please. Four eyes with four different emotions looked at each other across the chasm of their broken lives. Ain then looked to Alexis, who remained still and observant in the doorway. She was glad-tonight she had something interesting to give the new recruit. She was losing interest in tossing unsatisfactory guards to these things.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sebill, nearly sobbing, tried futilely to find her husband in this man. Ain, however, flourished in the queens attention. Sebill was too confused to react when Ain grabbed her throat and throttled her. He found little resistance from her body as Alexiss blood burned inside him. His wifes essence slipped away and Ain looked to his queen for affirmation.', 'en_US'),

"I commend you on your haste, we here are great appreciators of body magic, you know. You ought to be well paid for your effort.

Im Odea, hes Hahm, in case he didnt introduce himself."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Anton," said the coachman.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Odea turned to examine Sebill. "Lets get a look at you... Even better than I expected! Lets get you on the table." Anton stepped forward to help lift Sebill, but saw it was unnecessary as Odea, despite her size, moved Sebill to the dwarf-sized table without effort. Odea smiled, "Shes empty. No organs. I asked our clients in Nubia to clean her to prevent spoiling. Kept out of the sun the bodies can make the trip in adequate shape." Anton nodded. Odea thought he seemed uneasy. "Im sorry, did you know her?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"No, no... I have no idea who she is, or why shes important to the nobles. She doesnt look like an aristocrat." He paused, then motioned toward the door, "I have the rest of the delivery in my carriage."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Her blood Im sure. Would you fetch that? Hahm needs to check it and make sure the preservers held up. There are a number of naturally occurring blood thinners in just about every land, but ours are better. I have some theories about speeding the reactions to make the ink less corrosive, but that would require entropy mana which can be hard to come by..."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Outside, Anton gave the blood to Hahm and moved his horses into the shade. This was his first visit to the Luchuirp lands. He admitted to himself that hed always been a little racist toward dwarves, but couldnt think of any reason why. He looked at and admired the structure of the Catacomb Libralus, from what hed heard he assumed it was nothing more than a one-trick curiosity shop. It was originally built as a catacomb open to all, until necromancers developed a habit of exploiting it, leading to the pejoration of the name "Free-Use Catacombs." Later it was acquired by a wealthy polymath, who turned it into the institution that is now commonly nicknamed the "Catacomb Librarius." Above ground it was a simple structure with short walls and an entrance adorned with arches and pillars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anton returned to the workshop to see Odea in the process of skinning Sebill. Incisions ran up the middle of her chest, along her collarbone, and above her hips. Odea was paring the fatty membrane holding skin to muscle as she pulled the skin upward. Anton groaned at the sight, which alerted Odea that hed returned. She explained, her enthusiasm outweighing her sympathy for Antons uneasiness, "The skins in good shape. We use it all. Her back-because its smoother and thicker-will be tanned and used to make the cover. The rest we stretch into vellum for the pages." Odea paused, Anton was staring at Sebills body. "Its not pretty, I know. This is an honorable afterlife though. I used to do golemcraft, but animating a golem is like rolling a stone down a hill-its predictable, its all it does. Books are the perfect synthesis of form and function, body and spirit, mythos and logos. They are us in every way." She put down her knife, and Anton sat on short ladder. Odea continued, "We can put any talent to use here. Do you practice magic?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I do some, just tricks to help my deliveries-speed the horses, hide my wares. Just dabblings."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Ice! Imagine what you could do with ice mana! We could add people from any corner of Erebus to our collection. You could make your fortune just transporting food to soldiers. Ah, if only we could get some..." Anton laughed. Hed thought of this before. Odea continued, "We use a range of magic here: body helps us transform the person, but thats mostly handiwork, our diviners use spirit magic to contact the dead, and enchanters can infuse the books with special properties. Luckily were in a land where necromancy is outlawed, or wed have a lot to worry about. Should I take you to see some of our collection?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Thank you," he replied, "but I have to stable my horses first. I should find an inn."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Fine by me. I need to work and I cant have distractions. Come back later for a tour." Odea smiled, "Now get out of here."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A week had passed since Anton delivered Sebill. Hed gone north to meet a Calabim rendezvous who took the carriage, leaving Anton with a horse. Now returning to the fortified city, he spent the evening at a public house, waiting for nightfall. He made his way back to the Catacomb Libralus and to the door marked "Acquisitions." He knocked. If Odea answered hed have an excuse for being there. If she didnt, then things would be according to plan. He picked the lock and slipped inside. There was barely any light and he waited for his eyes to adjust. The tables were clean and the tools put away. A door in back opened to a lantern-lit corridor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When he entered the main hall he realized hed underestimated the age and grandeur of this place. He thought the library at his former mages guild was large, but hed never seen this many books. The hall was lined with shelves of books in every skin color, all facing out. Numerous corridors descended into the catacombs, all filled with books. Anton despaired when he wondered how he would find a single book in all this, until he saw the years inscribed above the corridors arches.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He entered the most recent corridor, which had just started to be used in the last five years. He walked straight to the end of the row. A small engraving was underneath the last book. Some Malakim name, the book was too dark anyway and had a tattoo of a lion on the cover. The second-to-last book was a pale tan, like a dry meadow. The engraving underneath read "unknown" and named the year of death. The book before that was grayish green and had a single horn jutting out from the spine. He picked up the tan one. It was about two hands tall and a little less wide. The cover was soft-it was leather after all. The spine was sturdy. Bone? He imagined it was her sternum, and thought of her breasts, one skinless, the other just dead. He opened the cover and ran his finger along the inside spine. The pages were sewn to the cover using string made of brown hair. There was writing on the first page, in ink that was still reddish and had not faded into brown. It said: My dear Ain-Youll never read this, but please know that I love you eternally. A chill shook him. He tucked Sebills book into his pack and returned to the main hall.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He looked at the dates above the arches, and walked down the next corridor. Both sides of the corridor were lined with books facing each other. A jumble of names grew in his head as he scanned the engravings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Are you looking for something, Anton?" He spun to see Odea in the middle of the corridor. She looked relaxed, he tried his best to appear the same. Her apron was gone and she was dressed comfortably, striking Anton as quite pretty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Um... yes. A book. A book of... my grandfather."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Anything else?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"...No."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What was his name?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anton glanced toward the main hall to see if Odea was alone. "Gerard Cormand."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I know of him! Quite the revolutionary in his day. Did you know him?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I didnt. My father opposed his politics and left the city, taking his family along. I was born on a farm."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Your grandfather was murdered before the revolution ended, wasnt he?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Yes. I have to know that it wasnt... my father."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Your grandfather is here," she pointed farther down the corridor. Anton cautiously followed her lead. "Our diviners enjoy limited success as a writing tool for the dead, allowing them to make a final statement."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The dead write?" probed Anton.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"We ask them if theres anything theyd like to say. Theyre usually thinking about what they would have done differently in life, so theyre full of advice. They might eulogize themselves, or tell their entire lifes story-we give the diviners a short vacation to recover after those. These are good souls, mind you, we dont even want to know the dangers of making an unscrupulous book."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"That woman," thought Anton, "what had she done to make her so valuable to the Calabim?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Victims of murder usually have something to say..." Odea stopped walking and motioned toward a book, smaller than Sebills and paler.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anton said, "Would he have named his killer?" Odea didnt answer, and Anton lifted his grandfathers book. He opened it and read: I liked the fleshy sins best. He turned the pages: blank. He sighed deeply, and put the book down. Odea took a step back. "Are you going to return the other book too?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anton faced Odea with a widened stance. "No. Im sorry, but Im stealing it." He held a knife at her eye level and took a slow step toward her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I cant stop you," she said calmly. "This is a mistake though. These books are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands. They must never leave."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I know. Your Ã‚â€˜clients havent given me any choice though." They circled each other in a cautious dance. Seeing the main hall clear, Anton left through the front door.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Outside the city walls, Anton snuck to his horse, mounted her, and pointed her back north. He hadnt ridden far when a sudden strong wind, or thats what it felt like, threw him off his horse, spilling his pack. He saw in the dark the looming shape of a gargoyle, its wings blocking the light from the city. He ran, and would have died on the spot if it werent for his haste spell.

It was a few days since her birth but she was already the greatest predator in creation and hunted without fear. It was spring and the sun, filtered through the leaves, created a net of light on the forest floor. There was no night in this world, it was caught in permanent day and made any time equally good for hunting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then two gods surrounded her. They held a thousand forms, and the world reacted to their thoughts. In one vision Junil seemed to swing a brilliant white sword at her only to have it blocked by the shield of Camulos. In another a tree broke and collapsed on her, but a wolf leapt and knocked her out of the way. In another the gods simply stood on each side of her, considering their possible actions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella suspected this last vision was the true one, but the world seemed to ripple out from the gods as if it was only smoke someone had passed their hand through. Not only did the hand change the direction of the smoke, but the wind that followed it. Even the most minor thoughts of the gods changed the world, and these werent minor thoughts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Junil wanted her dead and Camulos stood protectively over her, and the power of his dominion held Junil at bay.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella fled into the trees, running from shadow to shadow back to the place of safety that Ceridwen had provided her, the Bair of Lacuna. She briefly came out of the shadows to cross a small glade and almost ran into a figure standing in the shadows on the other side. He was massive and well muscled, more so than any other god and he radiated an aura of virility and masculinity. It was Aeron.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Calm, child," he said, "I do not wish you harm."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella adjusted quickly, cutting around the opposite side of a massive oak and sprinting on.

She could feel the heat of his body against her and was helpless in his grip.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What do you want of me?" she screamed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I mean to enjoy my creation, and that you would know the affections of a god. That you would have children devoted to me who are strong, cunning and immortal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In that moment the One entered creation. For a brief second Os-Gabella felt like she was every part of creation. She was the sunlight filtering through the leaves, the patchwork of grass it fell upon, the river that flowed past Nemeds farm, the clouds in the sky. She was the god that was about to rape her, and the woman about to be raped. She was everything in creation at once. And creation was only her alone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In that moment she knew the mind of every god, and she felt their fear, mistrust and jealousy. She knew their strength and weaknesses. And she loved and hated each of them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The One stood on a white stone slab looking out across creation. The 21 gods appeared around him, each afraid and ashamed for different reasons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mammon was consumed with his own dwindling time. He had only a precious few moments of life left and he watched them slip uselessly through his fingers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares rushed the One, wings unfurled he leapt into the air before him, sword raised high. The One simply caught the charging angel in one hand and threw him down. The force of the blow shattered the Angel and left him lying broken in the dirt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The One raised one hand toward Mammon. The arm rose like an hourglass with only a few remaining grains of sand. When it was fully raised Mammons vision would end, he would be no more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then Mammon heard Agaress voice, "Flee, rebel, forget."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And in that moment he did. He betrayed his dominion, turned against the One and felt a new power within him. A great desire that could never be filled. Blind to the future he became ruled by the need to control and possess. And he fled from the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aeron, Mulcarn, Esus, Ceridwen and Camulos fled as well. But destruction did not follow them. The One remained briefly in creation, meeting with the gods that remained loyal to him. Then he returned to the true heaven and sundered that path between heaven and creation.', 'en_US'),

For some, worship was to admire the ocean, to be present at its show. Others preferred immersion, giving their bodies to the water (metaphorically) as a way of saying "I owe you everything." Inside the temple the faithful bathed in the flowing water, letting the incense riding in the thick air penetrate their skin. Their minds flowed with the water and gave way to visions and serenity. A Priest of Whispers watched over as the din of the chamber filled with echoes of mumblings, humming, and short cries of ecstasy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Farther within the temple, Captain Grey-Eye of the Jury Rig raised his head after bowing to High Speaker The Bones of Its Mother Are Luminous Eyes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What have you brought us, Captain?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Grey-Eye was as faithful to the priests as any successful sea captain should be.

I accept the favor-what is it?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Im sending a priestess with you on your ship. She has a mission and you will find her abilities useful. Leave the book on the altar. Your service has been invaluable as always, Captain." Grey-Eye bowed his head and was escorted away. The Speaker regarded the book in front of him. The cover was a lightly colored and flimsy leather, dirty and weathered. The pages were becoming brittle. Human flesh no doubt, a product of the Catacomb Libralus, whose books were well guarded by the golems. No books ever left that city, making the Book of Sable especially rare. The High Speaker knew it was not chance, but the will of the unseen that brought the book to this temple.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He carried the book to the chamber of dreamers beneath the temple, where pools and pillars formed from mineral and organic deposits. The blessed seawater flowed throughout as dreamers lay in small pools. He approached a dreamer, a female in her teenage years, whose hair undulated like living tendrils in the water beneath her. A clay jar by her head had the words "the book of dead names sees beyond the depths" etched into it. The Speaker gave the book to one of the dreamers attendants and ordered that it be placed in an empty pool.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Speaker, do books dream?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"It is the ocean that dreams. We are blessed to be a part of it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A voice from one of the pools spoke, "the dreams of the unseen permeate all creation." Everyone awake in the room chanted in response, "the dreams of the unseen permeate all creation."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"And thus shall you be called," intoned the Speaker, his voice penetrating the sleep of the dreamer who spoke. He watched the attendant lay the book in the water. The attendant punctured a needle into the front cover, as he would into a vein, and lit the wick in the needles tube. He did this out of habit, the book lacked the biology to carry the smoldering waxs substance throughout the bloodstream, but this was how the dreaming was induced.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was two hours before any change was noted. The Speaker still stood over the dreamers, patient, faithful, and curious. The teenage girl stirred and minds melded in the stream. Her limbs twitched as the lingering consciousness from the book felt forgotten corporeality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Speak," commanded the Speaker. The girl remained silent and made small splashes as she moved. The Speaker said, "I seek the source of whispers."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He continued his commands until the girl settled down. Finally she spoke in her young voice, "I refuse."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You are powerless to refuse. You will navigate the sea of dreams and find for me the source."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I cant move."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Tell me what you see."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I see everything. The dreams of everything. All at once, every one a shadow, fluid."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Look beyond them."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"There is only darkness beyond the dreams."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Go there. I compel you." His voice reverberated in the chamber. He had not chosen to pursue this. He didnt consider it a choice. He was following the will of his masters, as spoken through the dreamers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Whispers... I feel them... Pressure... I cant understand them, but every syllable crushes me..."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Move toward it. I will speak to it."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Theres a being-shapeless, immense... theres... an eye-"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At that moment the temple erupted with shrieks and wails of terror and pain. The Speaker fell forward and moaned, devoid of any thought or function. The young dreamer convulsed and died. At the temples entrance worshippers ran into the town, possessed of nightmarish panic. They dashed themselves into walls and gouged at their throats with any tool available, trying to wake themselves from the nightmare they were in fact not in. Others remained in the temple, writhing and gurgling in the blessed water. Either they were stronger than the others, or perhaps more susceptible to the climactic vision, but they survived nonetheless. Of that moment, all could remember nothing more than the color yellow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The temple was soon reopened for public worship. The surviving worshippers who rose to prominence joined the remaining priests.

Such was his power that all he spoke and thought was Truth. When first he spoke he made a place of glory and a throne from which he could sit and view all of his creation. This place he named Heaven and his throne was called Order. The One spoke of a blue orb that rested on the arm of his throne. This orb he named Temporance and to it was given the power to control the flow of time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Time of Angels[\\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was now that the One began to speak of new creations. Each one he created he gave a unique name and the twin gifts of life and free will. Each creation was created differently but to the whole he gave the name Angels. There were 21 angels created and each was appointed to be the head of a divine precept.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each Angel was made to serve the One and to serve the creations that would come after. For the first time other voices were heard as they began to sing and praise the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Angel were:[NEWLINE]Lugus- Angel of Light[NEWLINE]Sirona- Angel of Wisdom[NEWLINE]Bhall- Angel of Fire[NEWLINE]Nantosuelta- Angel of Faith[NEWLINE]Nemed- Angel of Life[NEWLINE]Amathaon- Angel of Fertility[NEWLINE]Junil- Angel of Justice[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Arawn- Angel of Death[NEWLINE]Oghma- Angel of Knowledge[NEWLINE]Danalin- Angel of the Water[NEWLINE]Dagda- Angel of Balance[NEWLINE]Kilmorph- Angel of the Earth[NEWLINE]Sucellus- Angel of Nature[NEWLINE]Tali- Angel of the Air[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Camulos- Angel of Peace, who would become the Angel of War[NEWLINE]Aeron- Angel of Strength, who would become the Angel of Rage[NEWLINE]Ceridwen- Angel of the Stars, who would become the Angel of Magic[NEWLINE]Mammon- Angel of Foresight, who would become the Angel of Greed[NEWLINE]Esus- Angel of Trust, who would become the Angel of Deception[NEWLINE]Mulcarn- Angel of Ice, who would become the Angel of Winter[NEWLINE]Agares- Angel of Hope, who would become the Angel of Despair[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Birth of Man[\\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Heaven was full of many wonders which the angels spent centuries studying and praising. When the One felt them ready he commanded them to take flight outside the boundaries and to fill the vacuum with creations that mirror those of Heaven. He gave them the power of creation. So the angels set off in every direction, creating as it pleased them to create a host of worlds true and good that would serve the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the creation was done there was a variety of worlds and a nearly endless array of life upon them. Each angel created a world in their own preference and all the angels contributed to a common world, called Erebus, which was their greatest creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although all manner of life and substance had been created in the world the angels wished to create something greater than their individual aspects. Together they agreed to create a race of men that would contain a gift from each of them. This race would be directly descended from the angels and Nemed agreed to sacrifice his precept and become the father of this new race. His precept, that of Life, was given over to Arawn and the angels created an immortal female named Gabella to serve as his wife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The one entered creation where he stood upon a white stone slab and viewed all things. Seeing this work as good the One took back the power of creation from the angels.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Fall of Agares[\\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unknown to the other angels, and some say even to the One himself, Agares was not willing to lose the power of creation. Knowing he could not hope to keep the power from being taken from him and that he would be left only with the power to manipulate what already existed he used the power while he had it to create infinite wells of raw elements, air, earth, fire, water, life and death. At the center of these infinite reaches he placed gems of each of these elements which he had secreted out of heaven itself. When the power of creation was lost to him he still had enough matter and energy that he could go on creating until the end of time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the power of creation was gone to him he continued creating in his own world, which he called Nyx, with his infinite plains of elements. He created Nyx not in the fashion of heaven but as he desired. The creatures of this world were not told of other angels or the One, and Agares commanded they worship him alone. Nyx was a world painted in black and gold, a shadowy reflection of heaven, where the precept of hope controlled every aspect. Dreams, desire, worship and want ruled the shallow creatures that inhabited the beautiful world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other angels noticed that Agares continued creating. Agares claimed that it was cruel to take the power of creation away from them and that the One was jealous that their creations had outshone heaven itself. Six angels sided with Agares as they were eager to regain the power of creation and he showed them his infinite wells and how to use them to create. These angels were Camulos, Aeron, Ceridwen, Mammon, Esus and Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was then that the One intervened. Seeing Agares blasphemy he sought to remove it from all of creation. By this point however Agares taint had spread through all of creation, nothing existed that would still exist if he removed the evil from it. Unwilling to destroy creation the One condemned all the Angels out of Heaven, to live among creation until the day he returns to separate the good from the evil. The One tasked the angels still loyal to him with protecting creation and guiding it toward enlightenment until the day he returned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those angels that followed Agares opposed the Ones decree and took up arms against the angels loyal to him. From this point on the angels that fell were known as Evil by men, those that opposed them and were charged with protecting mankind were known as good and the 7 tasked with maintaining the functions of creations besides man were known as the angels of Neutrality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After throwing all of the angels from Heaven the One sundered the path between Heaven and Creation so that none but him could pass between them. In response to this all the angels, except Agares, created a host of new angels to serve them. The first they created was their archangel, and behind them thousands more to spread their will across creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The archangels were:[NEWLINE]Amathaon- Maponos the Young[NEWLINE]Sucellus- Cernunnos[NEWLINE]Bhall- Brigit the Shining[NEWLINE]Kilmorph- Goibniu[NEWLINE]Lugus- Baelious ("fortune")[NEWLINE]Aeron- Odio (who was imprisoned by Kilmorph during the age of dragons)[NEWLINE]Dagda- Cassiel[NEWLINE]Mammon- Hastur, Lord of Nightmares[NEWLINE]Junil- Sabathiel[NEWLINE]Oghma- Embarr ("imagination")[NEWLINE]Camulos- The Avatar of Wrath[NEWLINE]Nantosuelta- Splendor[NEWLINE]Ceridwen- Kanna, Mistress of Pain[NEWLINE]Sirona- Pelian the Suffering[NEWLINE]Esus- Iaegus[NEWLINE]Tali- Leucetious (Bringer of Storms)[NEWLINE]Arawn- Gyra and Basium (the twins)[NEWLINE]Danalin- Condatis[NEWLINE]Mulcarn- Taranis the Unchanging[NEWLINE]Agares- None (until the later creation of Hyborem, Lord of the Balors)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But Agares, not satisfied to play the Ones game, did the opposite. He returned to Nyx and destroyed everything there, every creature he had created, every monument that had been built. In one burst of power the beautiful world of Nyx was reduced to ash. The world lies to this day barren, it is called the deepest hell and none would suspect that it was once a world of surprising life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Creation[\\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the beginning all manner of natural animals and plants existed in creation, much as in our world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella mirrored the rebellion of Agares by refusing to endure her role as a subordinate to man. She fled from Nemed and retreated to the Bair of Lacuna. Further generations of men have the gift of immortality removed from them. But still their divine birthright makes their soul immortal, even if their body fails. It is this connection to the divine, through the angel of Nemed, that allows men to channel the power of the angels and allows their souls to pass to them when they die.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the 6th generation of men Os-Gabella returned and stole two children, Alexis and Flauros to raise as her own. These children become the first vampires, killing others to sustain their life throughout the ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Dragons[\\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unable to overcome their differences the gods begin to war across creation. As in all things the gods desires become physically manifested and their aggression was acted out by powerful creatures that battle against each other. Dragons, giants, great elementals and the gods themselves unleashed incredible magic and threaten to destroy creation with it. Mountains are created and destroyed, chasms and lakes were created like gaping scars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time hundreds of angels succumbed to the whispers of Agares. These fell from the service to the angel that had created them. To this day Agares has more angels in his service than any other angel, but none of them were created by his hand. Even his archangel, Hyborem, is a corruption of another.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cernunnos, the great horned one, was the archangel of Sucellus. He dared to attack Agares directly. Agares picked up the powerful archangel and showed him visions of himself dark and corrupted. So powerful was the vision that it became real, splitting Cernunnos into two creatures. They were identical in form but the new creature, which Agares named Hyborem, was dark in aspect and colored in blood. Hyborem and Cernunnos fought but neither could defeat the other. As such, even the archangel of Agares was stolen from another, he is a perversion of the natural.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus and Danalin remain largely out of the fighting. Instead each tends to a group of men that venerate them and that become changed by the close presence of their god. For Sucellus these men become the Ljosalfar, elves born to nature. For Danalin these men become the Aifons, men who can breathe water as well as air.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mankind, the greatest pride of the gods, was almost threatened with extinction. Immanuel Logos, a tribal leader, began the order of the Elohim at the close of this age to care for those injured in the Godswar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When it becomes obvious that the gods battle threatens creation itself Dagda calls for the war to end. The gods meet and the compact is formed, an agreement that the gods would withdraw and only interfere with creation through certain limited means. The Godslayer is formed as a physical manifestation of that agreement, a weapon capable of killing any god.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For some the compact does too much. Basium, the archangel of Arawn, rebels and continues his battle against the Infernals regardless of the compact. For others it does to little. Cassiel, the archangel of Dagda, rebels believing that the gods should withdrawal completely from creation instead of using men to fight their battles for them. Cassiel enters creation to teach men to ignore the will of the gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Magic[\\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Without the destruction of the Godswar man is able to form civilizations. One empire of men is created, Patria, and the people learn from and trade with the Ljosalfar and the Aifons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Patrian nation becomes strong. Basiums battles are mostly in hell, Cassiel is revered among the Patrians who are more philosophical than religious. The children of Os-Gabella, who have learned to leech life from others to sustain their own, are a scourge to mankind and the only real predators to humanity. It is the most peaceful time in mans existence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time Kheldon Ki sculpts the dwarves from his prison home and they are given life by Kilmorph. They tunnel out over a few generations, exploring the underworld. They settle on hills near the human lands. After abuse by corrupt Patrian merchants, many will retreat back to their tunnels, forming the unified nation of the Khazad. Other tribes stay on the surface, creating the Luchuirp, open-sky Dwarves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin becomes the king of the Patrians. He is a wise and popular ruler, loved by his people. When his wife betrays him Kylorin considers suicide by jumping from the top of his palace. Ceridwen, queen of pain, talks to him there, offering him another deal. That she will give Kylorin eternal youth and have his wife be resurrected in a new form each time she dies so that he may find and remarry her without the memory of her betrayal. The price is that Kylorin will worship Ceridwen and lead the Patrians according to her desires. Kylorin agrees.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ceridwen gifts Kylorin with eternal youth and teaches him magic. He becomes the first archmage and begins teaching others how to use magic to enforce his ever more corrupt rule over Patria. In a few generations his rule is absolute and vile. Sorcerers practice bizarre experiments, creating creatures like manticores, chimera and trolls and rule the fiefdoms in their control as gods. Kylorin directly trains 21 students and puts each in charge of a separate magical school.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These were the names of Kylorins students:[NEWLINE]Air- Greysun[NEWLINE]Body- Kezef (whose experiments killed all the animals on the Grigi plains)[NEWLINE]Chaos- Carnivean[NEWLINE]Creation- Majen (elven)[NEWLINE]Death- Barbatos[NEWLINE]Dimensional- Os-Gabella[NEWLINE]Earth- Jenkin[NEWLINE]Enchantment- Velgyr[NEWLINE]Entropy- Asmoday[NEWLINE]Fire- Mikel Dylantyr[NEWLINE]Force- Paimon[NEWLINE]Ice- Badb[NEWLINE]Law- Soqed Hozi[NEWLINE]Life- Leucetios[NEWLINE]Metamagic- Gastrius[NEWLINE]Mind- Perpentach[NEWLINE]Nature- Herve[NEWLINE]Shadow- Wode (elven)[NEWLINE]Spirit- Laroth (who would create his own empire in the underworld)[NEWLINE]Sun- Tamesis[NEWLINE]Water- Trenton Majosi (aifon)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin eventually becomes regretful of what he has done to the empire of men and prays for help. Nantosuelta answers those prayers and teaches him how to be an even more powerful mage. Kylorin uses that power to lead a rebellion in his own empire. He sets about subduing or killing those sorcerers who refuse to repent, though some escape his purge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perpentach was a master of mind magic, and a favored student of Kylorin. Kylorin was unwilling to kill him, imprisoning him instead in a dungeon in the Palus (the Tower of Eyes), guarded by unthinking golems. But Perpentach was more talented than Kylorin suspected, and was able to send his consciousness out wandering further and further from his prison. Searching, creating illusions and controlling minds miles from the dungeon in a process that strained him to the point of fracturing his mind. But he drew hundreds of men to his prison, made them fight and defeat the golems, release him, and declare him their ruler.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The war splinters the empire with Kylorin leading good religious forces against the creations and unholy magic of the sorcerers. By the end 9 human nations have been formed, the Elohim keepers of memories and guardians of the sacred parts of the world, the Bannor, keepers of the sacred fire and the greatest enemies of the sorcerers, the Malakim, desert nomads and men of faith, the Lanun, traders and seamen, the Hippus, horse lords and mercenarys, the Grigori, followers of Cassiel, the Balseraphs, lead by the sorcerer Perpentach, the Illians, who dwelt in the tundra and ravaged lands, and the Calabim, who became ruled by Alexis and Flauros.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creation settled into its new form. There were still many powerful evils in the world. Sorcerers who still hid in the land and monsters who roamed the wilderness now that their masters were dead. There were many jobs for adventurers willing to recover lost artifacts or investigate hidden areas. And there were wars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was during this age that the Aifon Trenton Majosi set out on a quest to save his people. He returned with the only salvation possible, a ritual that would allow Danalin to enter creation and save his children. Rather than return to the Godswar Trenton didnt perform the ritual and the Aifons and Trenton were destroyed. The loss of his children from creation caused Danalin to withdraw, falling into a sleep from which he hasnt yet woken.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares, the first to fall, whispered to Bhall, the angel of fire, and she eventually succumbed to his words. This was the end of the age of magic. Bhall fell from heaven and that night the sky rained fire. Men loyal to her were transformed into hideous orcish races, becoming the Clan of Embers. The capital of the Bannor empire, which held her greatest temple, dropped with her into hell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ritual uncovered by Trenton Majosi had found its way into the Illians hands. They had no fear of a Godswar, since Bhall was responsible for opposing their patron deity Mulcarn. With Bhall fallen their lord was unopposed, and this dispossessed people saw an opportunity to have more than the scraps left for them by the rest of humanity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The world was on fire and although many seers and prophets immediately knew when the ritual began few empires could afford to send armies to stop the ritual that was being performed. Only a the Luchuirp rallied an army. They were golem makers so the burning food supplies didnt affect their army as strongly as other nations. The Luchuirp assailed the Illian capital with the full force of their battle machines, but they were too late. Just as they broke through the city walls Mulcarn entered creation and with a whisper the Luchuirp army was wiped out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A permanent winter set in across creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Ice[\\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gods considered this breaking of the compact. They were unwilling to restart the Godswar, but couldnt let Mulcarn move into creation unchallenged. They agreed to let one god go into creation to fight Mulcarn. That god was Sucellus, the god of nature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus entered creation and battled with Mulcarn. At the same time the Ljosalfar turned on themselves. They had agreed to shared power between two queens, one to rule during summer and the other during winter. The winter queen claimed dominance for years as winter showed no signs of ending and refused to give up the throne. This argument created a civil war and the new branch loyal to the winter queen called themselves the Svartalfar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus lost the battle and was killed by Mulcarn. Creation froze even further and the elves were forced to stop their civil war as they could no longer mobilize armies or travel. They tried to find hidden places in the world to remain, and waited for the winter to end to continue their war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The empires of man were crushed by the blizzards and the power of Mulcarn. A few scattered tribes remained, but even these were little more than animals on the edge of survival. All the advancement of the Age of Magic was lost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Illians themselves lived better than most, but their god had little compassion and even they were forced to forgo basic conveniences or technology to maintain the unchanging will of Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some tribes gathered together into a new civilization, the Doviello. These men embraced their bestial nature and became more like a pack of wolves then men. They served a use to Mulcarn, by hunting and killing other tribes, and not interfering with the actions of the Illians. And they had little interest in the advancement and change that Mulcarn abhorred so they were allowed to remain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One corner of Erebus held a respite from the winter. The fiery pit that had been the temple dedicated to Bhall held a small portion of her essence, and so continued to burn, giving shelter to the orcs, who prospered in their corner of the world. Meanwhile their kin the Bannor, trapped in Hell, faced a constant struggle for survival. Junil, admiring their determination, sent his Archangel Sabathiel to lead them out. They emerged late in the Age of Ice, in the heart of the orcish territory, sparking a rivalry that persisted for generations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creation would have remained indefinitely like this had Kylorin not returned. He gathered the scattered tribes of men under one banner, naming them the Amurites. He reforged the broken pieces of the Godslayer and took it into battle against Mulcarn, killing him and ending the Age of Ice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Rebirth[\\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the death of the god of winter Sucellus was reborn, now the god of life. For the first time a god passed between the underworld and creation and doorways were opened between these realms. Through one a group of living elves, pulled long ago into the Dungeon of Laroth, escaped. They brought with them some stolen tomes from Laroths studies in the underworld. One of which would be used by Sandalphon to teach men to become shades and create the Sidar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Much like the Doviello of the prior age men from various tribes began to gather under a dark banner. This time they are responding to a promise of arcane power. Lead by Tebryn Arbandi and Os-Gabella they are called the Sheaim, powerful summoners who share their secrets openly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lastly Hastur, archangel of Mammon, invades the watery vault of Danalin. Finding the god still sleeping Hastur begins whispering to him, causing nightmares that are reflected in creation.', 'en_US'),

He liked creation, the smells of fresh earth and growing things, the mix of warm sunlight and cool breezes. But a world is more than the material and his mind was exploring one of his own creations, mathematics.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The One had removed the power of creation from them, but the gods were still powerful. Though the laws of Erebus were set, they could easily bend them. But in time they would return to their natural state. Mammon wished he could remake some of the laws he had applied, and even now played with changing them and watched the impact of his changes on the clouds that drifted overhead. The way the clouds split, funneled, dispersed and moved were minutely changed by the slightest of his adjustments.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the god of foresight Mammon watched the world play out due to his tiny changes. The clouds shadow that uncovered a mother mouse a second sooner. The hawk that spotted the now uncovered mouse. The mouse that would die in the hawks claws. The mouse babies that would starve without their mother. The seeds that would not be eaten by the mice. The plants that would now grow from those seeds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The clouds rolled towards the west, they were bone white and hung low in the sky. All except a single cloud that traveled east, seemingly ignoring all natural laws. Mammon considered the futures changed by the defiant cloud. Weather patterns changed, storms that would and wouldnt occur now. The changed world that existed because of that cloud.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Would you be so quick to change everything if you knew the implications of your actions?" Mammon asked the sky.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tali, god of the air, smiled down at the serious god, "I suspect that everything turns out the same no matter what we do."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mammon frowned, "That is not true."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But secretly Mammon wondered if Tali was right.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A distant ceremony beckoned to both the gods. All the gods gathered around a shallow pool and with a thought Mammon and Tali joined them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Within the pool a woman floated, perfect of form with smooth, pale skin and long, black hair. She was to be Gabella, formed by Aeron into the first woman and she was receiving a blessing from each of the gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bhall, goddess of fire, floated in the pool with Gabella and fire danced across the pools surface and shimmered in its depths. Bhall held the sleeping Gabella and whispered into her ear, "I give you the capacity for passion and love, that you can give these gifts to others and can receive them to yourself."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At that she kissed Gabella gently on the forehead. Gabella continued to float as Bhall let go and stepped out of the pool. Ceridwen came next, floating above the pool she allowed the long tendrils of her gown to reach down and lift Gabella gently to her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oghma was watching Mammon closely. The two were as close as their precepts, Oghma was knowledge of everything that was and Mammon was the god of knowledge of everything that will be. The thin line of the present separated their dominions and because of that the gods had a close affinity for each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Deciding that something had changed Oghma whispered to Mammon, "You seem bothered."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nemed spoke to all the gathered gods before Mammon could respond.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I mean to give her eternal life. That mankind can share our immortality and live without death."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gods considered, all life in creation was meant to be temporary. They were not making gods, but a world with seasons and cycles. Arawn was the first to respond.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"They have not known heaven, but they will yearn for it. Are you sure that our creation is so perfect that it should be unending?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At that the gods all began speaking at once. Only Agares, who watched without comment, and Mammon stayed out of the conversation. Mammon already knew the outcome. It was the same as any major decision they had to make, they would ask him. It was Nemed who asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Mammon, what do you foresee for Gabella and her children? Should she live eternal, or live only for a time within creation?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the first time Mammon was afraid to answer. Something was wrong, and for one who always knew the future being blind to it terrified him. Mammon could see the creation of Gabella, could see her rebellion and refusal to submit to the plan of the gods. Beyond that he saw the rebellion of Agares, and his attempt to challenge the One. He saw the One standing in creation, judging the world. But he couldnt see anything beyond that moment. If there was any future beyond that he was blind to it. Mammon suspected that the One unmade them and creation. He suspected that he was seeing his own death.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In regards to Gabellas immortality, for the time that Mammon could see there was no difference. With or without eternal life Gabella would refuse to become the mother of humanity. With either option she would live until Mammons vision failed him. She would live as long as Mammon would.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rather than admit that his vision was gone, rather than tell the gods that Agares would betray them, that they would all die, Mammon pretended to know and for the first time gave advice without knowing if it was correct.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Allow them to be immortal, they should not fear death." Mammon was beginning to know that fear to well himself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Arawn seemed bothered by the response but said nothing. Nemed entered the pool, embraced Gabella and whispered into her ear. From that moment she was as immortal as a single god could make her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mammon was next. He walked across the surface of the pool and sat down at Gabellas side.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Wake child." He said softly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella sat up and her eyes fluttered open. She was still in the daze of birth and likely wouldnt see or remember him, but he wanted to see her eyes. Aeron had fashioned her body perfectly, she was beautiful, strong and unique in feature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I give you..." Mammon leaned close, so that no one could overhear, "I give you nothing, so that you might always wonder and wont know the pleasures and the pains of the future."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella lay back down in the pool and returned to her sleep. Agares was the last to give his blessing and he stepped into the pool. At his touch the water changed to a blend of black and gold, a beautiful labyrinth or bright gold veins appearing and disappearing into emptiness. The gold strands caressed Gabellas body and again her eyes fluttered open to meet Agaress gaze.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I give you hope, a belief in what can be, that you will not know despair."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oghma was watching Mammon closely, he would be the only one who knew that Mammon didnt give a gift to Gabella. Similarly Mammon watched Agares, searching unsuccessfully for some hint of his future betrayal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=SPELL_ESCAPE]Chapter 2: Fall of Mammon Cycle[\\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=IMPROVEMENT_SEVEN_PINES]Chapter 3: Fall of Mammon Cycle[\\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=BUILDING_ALTAR_OF_THE_LUONNOTAR]Chapter 4: Fall of Mammon Cycle[\\LINK]', 'en_US'),

This time the gifts were to be less than those given to Gabella, so she wouldnt be pulled in different directions by each of their aspects. And she would be mortal in form so that whatever she chose, she would not have a permanent impact on creation. Her soul was to remain immortal, and Arawn agreed to tend to her soul, and those of the mortal generations that would follow her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They named her Anesidora and she was as gentle as Gabella was fierce.

Auric was just growing into his affinity for magic at the time and as the elven warband set upon them he reached through the vale for any source of magic he could find to use. The faint source he felt through it was the Sun, when he pulled its power through he destroyed the barrier between the worlds and flooded the perpetually dark vale with light. The elvish warband was blinded, but Varn underwent a transformation, he saw Lugus in that light and was rewarded for his commitment to the truth (by trying to save the children) by becoming a priest of Lugus. He fled from the Vale into the cold wastes of Creation on whatever path Lugus had planned for him.', 'en_US'),
