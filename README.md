# Welcome
Mod to faithfully recreate the glorious Civ IV FallFromHeaven mod by Kael in Civ VI. 

To download the mod, git clone the repo. Put the downloaded folder in your Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Mods/ folder.
One the mod is out of Alpha (probably when art assets for three civilizations are done), I will publish on Steam Workshop.
At the moment the mod doesn't have the compiled art assets I have made, mainly because they are vey much incomplete, and I would need to upload them elsewhere as they are too large for github. As a result, mana resources will not show as 3d assets on the worldview.

Check out my [website](https://slothoth.github.io/Fall-From-Heaven/) where I will be detailing some of the progress I have made, cool screenshots of assets, and mechanics I have BEATEN civ vi into submission to get to work.
